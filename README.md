## Communication plan 

Communication channels: Discord for daily team conversation and syncing. We will be using email for formal way of communication.

Communication frequency: 20 mins long standup call on zoom for every altenate day to check the progress of the project

Work divison : Tasks are divided among team members efficiently any work overload can be brought to team notice and disucss to reslove them.

Meeting agendas: Update on tasks assigned to each individual, assigning new tasks and planning future developments, discussing issues faced and collectively working to fix them.

## First Choice :
Kaggle : [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
# Selection of data to analyze

The  dataset is the US Accidents dataset, which contains information about traffic accidents that occurred in the United States from February 2016 to December 2020. The dataset was compiled from various sources, including traffic cameras, accident reports, and social media, and contains information about the location, severity, and other factors related to each accident. The dataset includes features such as time and location of accidents, weather conditions, road conditions, descriptions of accidents, and information about people involved in the accidents. This dataset is relevant for traffic and transportation-related research and analysis, such as identifying patterns and factors associated with accidents, developing predictive models for accident occurrence, and designing safer transportation systems

# Business Problem or Opportunity

The US Accidents dataset from Kaggle can be used to analyze accident patterns and predict the likelihood of accidents. This information can help transportation and logistics companies optimize their routes and schedules, insurance companies optimize their risk assessment and pricing models, and public safety organizations develop targeted strategies to reduce accidents.
# Domain Knowledge
The expression "road incidents dataset" refers to a collection of data on accidents that take occur in roads, highways, and streets. One needs to have the following knowledge to be able to fully understand this dataset:
1. Traffic laws and regulations: Understanding a variety of mishaps, what causes them, and how they can be avoided needs knowledge of transportation regulations and laws. It involves being mindful of the legal speeds, lights, right-of-way rules, and road advertising.
2. Road engineering and design:To identify possible dangers on roads such as sudden turns, restricted lane lengths, and blind spots, it is crucial to understand the principles of road design and engineering. It also includes knowledge of the condition of the road's exterior, light, and other factors which impact road safety.
3. Vehicle safety: Understanding the severity of accidents and the possibility of injuries can be helped through knowledge of vehicle security features like safety belts, air bags, and anti-lock braking.
4. Emergency response: Knowing how events are reported, rescue efforts take place and the way the injured are treated needs knowledge of procedures for responding to emergencies.
5. Statistical analysis: Using methods of statistical analysis is required to assess the data and generate insightful findings. It consists of competence in hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and statistical analysis.
6. Data visualization: For the information to be effectively displayed in a relevant and intelligible style, knowledge of data visualization techniques is required. It comprises skill in the use of charts, graphs, and other visual elements that can be utilized to convey the findings derived from the data.
# Research Objectives and Question(s) (what you are trying to describe or predict with the data)
The agenda of our team is to identifying the strategies that could help us define the solutions to the below questions using suitable visualisations as part of our research work. 
Which states experience the most and least accidents?
What causes accidents most frequently in the US?
How many accidents cause fatalities or severe injuries each year in the US?
What effect do meteorological conditions have on accident rates in the US?
which 10 states experience the most accidents?

## Second Choice : 
Kaggle : [https://www.kaggle.com/code/corykjar/e-commerce-shipping-data-analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/corykjar/e-commerce-shipping-data-analysis)
# Selection of data to analyze

The dataset contains information related to the shipping of products purchased through an e-commerce platform. The data was collected from an e-commerce platform and contains information about the products ordered, the customers who placed the orders, and the shipping and delivery details.This dataset could be used for analyzing and optimizing various aspects of e-commerce shipping, such as shipping costs, delivery times, and customer satisfaction. It could also be used for building predictive models to forecast demand, optimize inventory, and improve supply chain management.
# Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge

The business problem or opportunity for the E-commerce Shipping Data Analysis dataset on Kaggle is to identify potential areas for improvement in the shipping process for an e-commerce company.

# Domain Knowledge:

The "E-commerce Shipping Data Analysis" dataset, that's available on Kaggle, includes information about orders and shipments from a company that sells online. The dataset contains details on order ID, client ID, product ID, delivery technique, shipping currently, delivery date, and shipping status, as well as data on the ordered products, such as category, sub-category, and quantity.

A number of the domain expertise applicable to this dataset is an understanding of the field of e-commerce, particularly all of the shipping decisions, fulfillment facilities, and administrative tasks of processing orders and deliveries. A background in retailing, logistics, or supply chain management may be helpful for the analysis of this dataset.

Order leadership, handling inventory, order fulfillment, optimization of the supply chain, delivery and shipping logistics, and client happiness measures are some particular topics within this field that might be pertinent to this data. To efficiently derive insights form the information and to clarify findings, it would also help to have a basic understanding of the visualization and analysis of data tools.
#  Research Objectives and Question(s) (what you are trying to describe or predict with the data)

The agenda of our team is to identifying the strategies that could help us define the solutions to the below questions using suitable visualisations as part of our research work. 
What variables are correlated to package arrival times ?
Do any seasonal trends or holiday seasons exist in the delay of the package
Are there any patterns or correlations between package disappearance and the type of product, geographic region, or delivery method used
Do we have any products that consistently have longer or shorter delivery times than others because of variables like product size or manufacturing place etc
Are there any correlations between delivery times and customer reviews or customer satisfaction for some products in some regions
